# Pi Mod for Minecraft PE
This mod for MCPE was coded during the Pi day (3/14/15).

It uses the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula to calculate the Pi  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula), and to have a better decimal precision it also used the decimal.js libary for Javascript made by MikeMcl: https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js
