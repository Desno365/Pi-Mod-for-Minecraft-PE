# Pi Mod for Minecraft PE
This mod for MCPE was coded during the Pi day (3/14/15).

It uses the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula to calculate the Pi  ([Wikipedia: Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula)), and to have a better decimal precision it also uses the [decimal.js libary for Javascript made by MikeMcl](https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js).<br>
